**Layoff Data Analysis**

This repository contains a dataset and analysis on layoff trends across various industries, companies, and countries. The dataset includes information about companies, their locations, industries, the number and percentage of employees laid off, and the funds raised by each company.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Company: The name of the company affected by layoffs.

Location: The geographic location of the company.

Industry: The sector to which the company belongs (e.g., Healthcare, Marketing, Crypto).

Total Laid Off: The total number of employees laid off.

Percentage Laid Off: The percentage of the workforce laid off.

Date: The date when the layoffs were announced.

Stage: The funding stage of the company (e.g., Series A, Series B, Post-IPO).

Country: The country where the company is based.

Funds Raised (Millions): The amount of funding raised by the company (in millions of USD).


**Data Cleaning**

I have performed the following data cleaning tasks:

1. Remove Duplicates - Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity and accurate analysis.
2. Standarize the Data - Ensured proper date formatting to facilitate time-based analysis.
3. Null Values or Blank Values - Handled missing values in the total laid off, Percentage Laid Off and Industry by replacing them with meaningful values or filling gaps based on available information.
4. Remove Any Columns- Removed missing or incomplete data points where necessary to ensure consistency in analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

In this analysis, I explored several trends and patterns, including:

Trends in layoffs by industry and company stage: Identifying which sectors or stages (e.g., Series A, Post-IPO) are more prone to layoffs.

Geographical trends: Comparing layoff data across different countries and regions, including the number of layoffs and the percentage.

Correlation between funding and layoffs: Investigating whether there is any connection between the amount of funding a company has raised and the number of layoffs.

**Key Findings:**

Healthcare and Technology industries seem to have experienced the highest number of layoffs in the past few years.

Post-IPO companies have had a relatively high number of layoffs compared to earlier-stage companies, suggesting the challenges faced as companies go public.

Geographical Distribution: The majority of layoffs are concentrated in the United States, with notable cases in Brazil and Canada as well.
